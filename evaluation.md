## Evaluation Ratings Legend

For each capability, consider using a standardized rating system:
- **Full Support (FS)**: Feature is fully implemented and robust
- **Partial Support (PS)**: Feature exists but may have limitations
- **Limited Support (LS)**: Basic implementation with significant limitations
- **Planned (P)**: On the roadmap but not yet implemented
- **Not Supported (NS)**: Not currently available or supported
- **Unknown (U)**: Information not available

## Tool Evaluation Summary

| Tool Name | Overall Score (1-10) | Best For | Not Recommended For | Final Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------------|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Apache Atlas | 7 | Hadoop-centric environments, Compliance-focused needs | Cloud-native deployments, Small teams with limited resources | Consider for agencies with existing Hadoop infrastructure and strong security/compliance requirements |
| AWS Lake Formation/Glue | 8.5 | AWS-centric organizations, Data lake governance, Cross-account data sharing | Organizations not using AWS, Budget-sensitive deployments, Complete vendor independence | Strong **commercial** option for agencies already invested in AWS ecosystem seeking centralized governance with federal compliance capabilities |
| CKAN | 6 | Public data sharing, Open data portals, Government transparency initiatives | Enterprise data governance, Sensitive data handling, Complex compliance requirements | Best suited for public-facing data portals rather than internal governance of sensitive information |
| Collibra Data Intelligence Platform | 9 | Agencies requiring FedRAMP compliance, Organizations with complex governance requirements, Environments with sensitive data requiring strong controls, Cross-agency data sharing and collaboration | Small teams with limited budgets, Projects requiring minimal governance, Organizations without dedicated data governance personnel | Highly recommended **commercial solution** for ACF given the need to handle sensitive information across programs while ensuring regulatory compliance. The FedRAMP authorization and established federal agency usage make it a lower-risk choice for implementation. |
| Databricks Unity Catalog | 8 | Organizations using Databricks, Unified governance of data and AI assets, Multi-cloud deployments | Organizations not using Databricks, Budget-constrained deployments | Best for agencies already using or planning to use Databricks as their analytics platform |
| DataHub | 8.5 | Organizations with complex data ecosystems that include both traditional data assets and AI/ML workloads | Small teams with limited resources or technical expertise | Strong candidate for larger agencies with complex data ecosystems, especially those involved in AI/ML initiatives |
| dbt | 7.5 | Data transformation workflows, Data testing, Pipeline documentation, Centralized metrics management | Complete data governance solution, Data discovery without additional tools | Good complementary tool to pair with a dedicated data catalog/governance platform, excellent for standardizing metrics definitions across tools |
| DKAN | 5.5 | Drupal-based organizations, Simple open data portals, Government data publishing | Enterprise data governance, Advanced governance features, Sensitive data handling | Suitable only if ACF has existing Drupal infrastructure and needs primarily for public data sharing |
| Great Expectations | 7.5 | Data quality validation, Automated data testing, Schema enforcement, Continuous data monitoring | Full data governance, Metadata management | Excellent complementary tool focused on data quality that integrates well with broader data platforms; superior choice for automated testing with AI assistance |
| OpenMetadata | 8.5 | Organizations seeking a unified metadata platform with strong governance capabilities and extensive connector support | Organizations with limited technical resources requiring minimal setup | Strong candidate for agencies seeking a modern, well-supported solution with broad connector support and comprehensive governance features |
