## Tool Evaluation Summary

| Tool Name | Overall Score (1-10) | Best For | Not Recommended For | Final Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------------|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Apache Atlas | 7 | Hadoop-centric environments, Compliance-focused needs | Cloud-native deployments, Small teams with limited resources | Consider for agencies with existing Hadoop infrastructure and strong security/compliance requirements |
| Collibra Data Intelligence Platform | 9 | Agencies requiring FedRAMP compliance, Organizations with complex governance requirements, Environments with sensitive data requiring strong controls, Cross-agency data sharing and collaboration | Small teams with limited budgets, Projects requiring minimal governance, Organizations without dedicated data governance personnel | Highly recommended for ACF given the need to handle sensitive information across programs while ensuring regulatory compliance. The FedRAMP authorization and established federal agency usage make it a lower-risk choice for implementation. |
| DataHub | 8.5 | Organizations with complex data ecosystems that include both traditional data assets and AI/ML workloads | Small teams with limited resources or technical expertise | Strong candidate for larger agencies with complex data ecosystems, especially those involved in AI/ML initiatives |
| dbt | 7.5 | Data transformation workflows, Data testing, Pipeline documentation, Centralized metrics management | Complete data governance solution, Data discovery without additional tools | Good complementary tool to pair with a dedicated data catalog/governance platform, excellent for standardizing metrics definitions across tools |
| Great Expectations | 7.5 | Data quality validation, Automated data testing, Schema enforcement, Continuous data monitoring | Full data governance, Metadata management | Excellent complementary tool focused on data quality that integrates well with broader data platforms; superior choice for automated testing with AI assistance |
| OpenMetadata | 8.5 | Organizations seeking a unified metadata platform with strong governance capabilities and extensive connector support | Organizations with limited technical resources requiring minimal setup | Strong candidate for agencies seeking a modern, well-supported solution with broad connector support and comprehensive governance features |
