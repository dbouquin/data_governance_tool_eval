# Data Governance Tools Comparison

## **Summary Recommendation**
- Collibra - leading commercial option with proven federal experience, if budget allows
- OpenMetadata - leading Open Source option for modern data environments
- AWS - strongest cloud-based option if ACF is already invested in AWS infrastructure

For ACF's environment, OpenMetadata's architecture would likely provide adaptability across diverse systems and data types. OpenMetadata's active development community and growing feature set also suggest that it will continue to evolve to meet emerging governance needs. 
**A hybrid approach combining OpenMetadata as the core platform with specialized tools like Great Expectations ([connector](https://docs.open-metadata.org/v1.6.x/connectors/ingestion/great-expectations)) for data quality could provide an excellent solution that balances comprehensive governance capabilities with flexibility and modern architecture.**

<sup>1.  Many of the tools used within AWS are built on Open Source technologies, but AWS itself is not Open Source. AWS has been included as ORR already hosts its systems in AWS and the general purpose tools can be configured for data governance purposes.</sup>

<sup>2. [CKAN has a Drupal implementation called DKAN](https://dkan.readthedocs.io/en/7.x-1.x/introduction/dkan-ckan.html)</sup>

<sup>3. Collibra is not an Open Source platform but has been included because HHS currently uses Collibra (though it is not offered to ACF as a service by HHS)</sup>

<sup>4. dbt is primarily a data transformation tool that has data governance features</sup>

<sup>5. Great Expectations is primarily a data quality and validation tool that has data governance features</sup>

<sup>6. Oracle is included as the native solution for comparison</sup>
